# Web Gourmet - Frontend

## Description
Web Gourmet is a web application that allows users to input a website URL, then proceed to ask any questions they may
have about the website.
The application will then provide a response to the user's question.
The frontend application is built using Next.js and TypeScript.

This is achieved using the embedded-search capabilities of openAI's GPT models.
